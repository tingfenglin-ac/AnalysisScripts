This function is a modified version of the ImportHEKA.m function included in the sigTOOL package. sigTOOL can be downloaded here, where it is licensed under a GNU GPL license: http://sigtool.sourceforge.net/sigtool.html

To function properly, the ImportHEKAtoMat function must be placed in the sigTOOL folder: 'sigTOOL\sigTOOL NeuroscienceToolkit\File\menu_Import\group_NeuroScience File Formats'

sigTOOL must be run at least once in a given Matlab session before the function can be used.

This function was modified by Sammy Katta to output the Patchmaster tree to matlab and to read in the bundled .pgf stimulus file.
